This project aims to provide a simple and efficient way to manage schools, classes, and students using CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations through a web-based interface. The system includes controllers for School, Class, and Student entities, allowing you to seamlessly interact with and manage your school-related data.

## Features

- **CRUD Operations:** The project offers Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations for School, Class, and Student entities, giving you full control over your data.

- **User-Friendly Forms:** The Create Class and Create Student forms have been enhanced to provide a user-friendly experience. The Create Class form allows users to choose between 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th-year classes. The Create Student form lets users select a birthday using a DateField and choose gender through radio buttons.

- **Easy Navigation:** Links to the CRUD controllers for School, Class, and Student entities are readily available, ensuring quick access to the desired data management tasks.

## Usage

Once the project is set up and the development server is running, you can use the web-based interface to perform various tasks:

- **Creating a School:** Navigate to the School CRUD controller and click "Create School." Provide the name of the school and submit the form.

- **Creating a Class:** Access the Class CRUD controller and click "Create Class." Choose the school, name, and year of the class from the form.

- **Creating a Student:** Go to the Student CRUD controller and click "Create Student." Select the class, name, birthday, and gender of the student using the user-friendly form.

- **Updating and Deleting:** You can update or delete existing records in a similar manner through the respective CRUD controllers.
